Visulaisation of Australian Mean Temperature Anomalies from 1910-2021 

Have we already reached 1.5 Degrees Celsius temperature increase in Australia? The data seems to say so. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology (http://www.bom.gov.au/) calculated the average temperature from 1961 to 1990. This value is 21.8 degrees Celsius. Based on this, we can then look at the actual annual average temperature deviation from 1910 to 2021 to see if they are above or below this average of 21.8 degrees Celsius. As you can see, the last two decades have been hotter (dark red bands).

The politicians and policies should really be addressing 1.75 degrees or worst case 2 degrees. All talk of 1.5 degrees is pretty much outdated and gives us a false sense of hope.

The inspiration for the above chart is from climatologist Ed Hawkins - (https://lnkd.in/g3Fmfi_m) - you can read about it here: https://lnkd.in/g6FBYK2J
